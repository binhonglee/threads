            <p class="text">Keeping a weekly note at work 
            <br />
            <br />Earlier this year, I started a routine at work where at the end of the week, I'll make a post with a list of things I've done for the week.
            <br />
            <br />Thread...</p>
            <p class="text">At first, I did this mostly because I've previously found myself going through multiple weeks of unproductive slumps and figured this is a good way to keep myself accountable and quickly figure out how to get myself back on track.</p>
            <p class="text">I slowly add more stuffs to it overtime (and still do). It used to just be actual work "work" but now I also include procrasti-work (non-urgent stuff you do because you're procrastinating on actual work) or just anything I did that I think is of value.</p>
            <p class="text">Over time, I realized that it helped curb my imposter syndrome as I see that I can consistently complete and deliver stuff week in and week out.
            <br />
            <br />It also became a lot more obvious when I'm consistently stuck at something and it's time to ask for (more) help.</p>
            <p class="text">I've found it easier to go back to previous issues, discussions, conversations that I had previously.
            <br />
            <br />Similarly, it's easier to catch patterns where there are consistent issues and we should establish proper process of handling it instead of constantly making one off fixes.</p>
            <p class="text">When I write my personal performance review, I used to have moments where I was feeling like, did I do almost nothing for a whole month? Cause I can't find anything.
            <br />
            <br />In reality, anything that's not code is less visible thus have little proof of existence.
