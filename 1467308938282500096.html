            <br />Most people will tell you that the best way to learn is to build something with it. This is üíØ true but there's slightly more nuances to it.
            <br />
            <br />/#WeeklyThread üßµ</p>
            <p class="text">First question a lot of people always have is "what to build"? Well, its usually is something you need / want to have exist but not yet. Or, go ham and over-engineer your personal site / blog. Build a new section with new features. It's your site, do whatever you want.
            <br />/1</p>
            <p class="text">Dive head first into building it. You can skip the "best practices" advice for now and just look for answers to unblock yourself when you run into issues. Keep going until you feel sufficiently confident with the new stack. (e.g. creating custom objects / classes etc)
            <br />
            <br />/2</p>
            <p class="text">Now you're more prepared to read and better understand why / what all the best practice / recommended style advices are about. Look them up and understand their reasoning. Make the appropriate changes to your project by applying those advice.
            <br />
            <br />/3</p>
            <p class="text">Deploy that thing for people to try out. Could be your Twitter followers or your friends and families. "Hey I built this new thing! Please come try poke at it." Collect feedbacks / wishlists and go back to step 2. Repeat. 
            <br />
            <br />/4</p>
            <p class="text">That's it for the week. Hopefully you find this thread helpful. Let me know if there's anything else you want by me to tweet about! üòÅ
