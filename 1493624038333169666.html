              <p class="text">Big facts! Also the other companies are sticking with WFH while the FAANG companies are working on returning to the office.</p>

                <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/femalemsktr" >@femalemsktr</a> What you experienced is exactly why I avoid FAANG. Sure it’s a bragging right but I’d go crazy going through all those interviews just to get rejected.
                <br />
                <br />Nun wrong with a Fortune 500 w/ a 1-3 step interview process. Or a smaller company w/ a dope product. A lot of them pay well 2

            <p class="text">On that note, AAPL is the most secretive of FAANG where first week at work likely entails getting a bunch of approvals to access different tools, code bases etc. There's a floating story where a couple both working there doesn't know what each other does because CONFIDENTIAL.</p>
            <p class="text">F otoh, runs monorepo system where engineers have access to all the source code on day 1. Plenty of stuff including research results, product roadmaps, experiment results are largely openly available company wide (thus more susceptible to leaks).</p>
            <p class="text">This is an example of polar opposite company culture. Trying to discuss them as a mono-culture just leads to people either cherry picking only the best of both worlds or the worst of both worlds and pretend they all happened in the same entity.
